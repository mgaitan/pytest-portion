Select a portion of the collected tests, so you can run diferents parts of your test suite
in differents instances to balance the number of test run on each one.

Use case
--------

Suppose you have a big, slow test suite, but you can trigger several CI workers
to run different portions of it, in a sake lazy/simple way to make it

A basic, obvious way to do that is to explictily
collect from different directories/modules

- worker1: ``pytest tests/a``    (100 tests, ~4 minutes to finish)
- worker2: ``pytest tests/b``    (20 tests, ~1 minute to finish)
- worker3: ``pytest tests/c tests/d``  (30 tests, ~1 minute to finish)

The problem is that directory `tests/a` may have a lot more tests that `tests/c` plus `test/d`,
so ``worker1`` takes a lot more to finish.

With ``pytest-portion`` you can still split the tests in different instances, but letting
the extension makes the selection in a more balanced way.

- worker1: ``pytest --portion 1/3 tests``   (50 tests, ~2 minutes)
- worker2: ``pytest --portion 2/3 tests``   (50 tests, ~2 minutes)
- worker3: ``pytest --portion 3/3 tests``   (50 tests, ~2 minutes)

In this case, the tests of all the directories are collected, but only a third (a different one!) of them will
be actually executed on each worker.

Note this balance if **by number of tests**, so if there is very slow tests in a particular portion,
the duration may not be expected.

For a fine tuning, you could pass the portion in a more explicit way:

- worker1: ``pytest --portion 0:0.5 tests``    (first half, 1st to 75th test)
- worker2: ``pytest --portion 0.5:0.8 tests``  (next 30%, from 76th to 125ยบ)
- worker3: ``pytest --portion 0.8:1 tests``    (last 20%)


Installation
------------

You can install "pytest-portion" via `pip`_ from `PyPI`_::

    $ pip install pytest-portion


Usage
-----

Pass ``--portion <i/n>`` where:

- ``n`` is the number of portions
- ``i`` is the i-th portion to select (``1 <= i <= n``)

.. note::

    If the number of tests collected is not divisible by `n`, the last portion will contain the rest.
    For instance, if you have `test_1`, `test_2` and `test_3`, `--portion 1/2` will run the first one,
    and `--portion 2/2` the last 2.



Alternatively ``--portion start:end`` where:

- ``start`` and ``end`` are the coefficient (between 0 and 1) that represent the segment of the collected tests
to select.
